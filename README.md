# Intelligent Cardio Monitoring System (Academic Project)

An intermediate-level cardiac monitoring system leveraging Machine Learning and AI for risk prediction.

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- **Visualization**: Chart.js/Recharts for real-time telemetry.
- **Offline ML**: Embedded `mlService.ts` simulating a trained model for instant results.
- **AI Intelligence**: Integrated Google Gemini API for advanced medical language processing and anomaly detection.

### 2. Backend (Python/Flask)
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for user management and high-fidelity ML prediction.
- **Database**: SQLite for persistent storage of users and health history.

### 3. Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn)
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier trained on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset.
- **Accuracy Target**: >85% (Subject to dataset quality and feature engineering).

## Setup Instructions

### Python Environment
1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy scikit-learn pandas joblib numpy
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Web Interface
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. For full AI functionality, ensure your environment provides a valid Google Gemini API Key.

## Educational Disclaimer
**IMPORTANT**: This application is a learning project intended for academic demonstration only. 
- It is **NOT** a certified medical device.
- Predictions generated by the ML model or AI should **NOT** be used for actual medical diagnosis.
- Always consult a professional healthcare provider for medical concerns.

## Data Persistence
The web application uses Browser LocalStorage for demo persistence. For the full multi-user academic setup, refer to the provided `app.py` and `database.sql` schemas.
